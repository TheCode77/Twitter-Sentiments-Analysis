# People Perception on Climate Change
### Using social media to determine people perception on climate change

## Project Overview

Many companies are built around lessening one’s environmental impact or carbon
footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and
sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how
people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat.
This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their
product/service may be received.

With this context, EDSA is challenging DATABOTICS Solutions during the Classification Sprint with the
task of creating a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a
person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.
Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a
broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and
geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future
marketing strategies. 

## Problem Statement

In order to mitigate the risk associated with climate change, our client is building toward lessening their environmental impact or carbon footprint by offering products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. Our client will like to determine how people perceive climate change, and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This will go along way to add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

## Objective

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives our client access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.

DATABOTICS Solutions is task with creating a sentiment analysis model that will be able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.

In order to achieve the objectives, our company will do the following:

- Analyse the supplied data.
- Identify potential errors in the data and clean the existing data set.
- Determine if additional features can be added to enrich the data set.
- Build a model that is capable of predicting tweet.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the best machine learning model.
- Determine what features were most important in the model’s prediction decision, and
- Explain the inner working of the model to a non-technical audience.

## Data Description and Sources

The collection of this data was funded by a Canada Foundation for Innovation JELF Grant to Chris Bauch, University of Waterloo. The dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43,943 tweets were collected. Each tweet is labelled as one of 4 classes, which are described below.

####  Class Description
- **[2] News**: the tweet links to factual news about climate change

- **[1] Pro**: the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change

- **[0] Neutral**: the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change

- **[-1] Anti**: the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change Variable definitions

####  Features
- **sentiment**: Which class a tweet belongs in (refer to Class Description above)

- **message**: Tweet body

- **tweetid**: Twitter unique id

####  Files provided
- `train.csv` - This data will be used to train our model.

- `test.csv` - This data will be used to test our model.

## Project Deliverables
### Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables as necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct EDA to understand the relationships between Sentiments, Message, and the Tweet ID.

### Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary and select relevant features for modeling.

### Model Building:

Develop and train a classification model to predict people's perception of climate change using the selected features.

### Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as F1 score, accuracy, and precision.

### Model Deployment:

Deploy the trained models for making predictions on new data.

### Documentation:

Create documentation that explains the data, methodology, and model for future reference.

### Project Timeline

The project will be conducted in phases, with each phase having specific tasks and deadlines. The timeline for the project will be determined by the project manager in consultation with team members.

### Data Volume

The dataset contains nearly 15819 rows, and its size may impact data processing and model training times. Appropriate hardware and software resources will be allocated to handle this volume effectively.

### Collaboration

The project team will collaborate closely to ensure the successful completion of each phase. Communication channels will be established to facilitate teamwork and knowledge sharing.

### Conclusion
The successful modeling of people's perception of climate change will add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received. Climate change is a complex problem, but it is one that we must solve. By working with you and Friends of the Earth International, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the impacts of climate change, and build a sustainable future for all.
